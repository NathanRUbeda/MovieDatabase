## Get Started
MovieDatabase is designed to work with an API key and an access token from [The Movie Database](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started). You will need to get a free API key and access token after [creating an account](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup). Follow these instructions:

1. Get the API key and access token.
2. Insert into your Xcode schema by clicking the target icon at the top > "Edit Schema" > Within "Run", select "Arguments", and add your API key value to an environment name of "API_Key" and your access token value to "Authorization".
3. Ensure you have signing capabilities enabled under the Project settings for the "MovieDatabase" target.
4. Run the app and enjoy checking your favorite movies!

## Testing
All UI and Unit Tests are designed not to require any additional dependencies. Therefore, you simply run the test and observe the result.
